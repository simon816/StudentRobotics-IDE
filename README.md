Student Robotics IDE
---

This is a plugin to [RText](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rtext/) that I used to develop the python code for the [Student Robotics](https://www.studentrobotics.org/) competition.

It uses the [SRobo IDE API](https://github.com/simon816/Student-Robotics-IDE-Java-API) I created for this purpose.

The code was originally written around January 2014.
